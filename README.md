# M5Stick Launcher
Application Launcher for M5StickC, M5StickC Plus, and M5StickC Plus 2.

Cardputer isn't working yet, need testing and debug. =(

Ir is mandatory that you have an [SDCard Hat](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6459069) to use with this Launcher and i have instructions [Here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6459069), Cardputer users naturaly donÂ´t need this Hat!

You can learn more about how it works o [M5Launcher Wiki](https://github.com/bmorcelli/M5Stick-Launcher/wiki/Explaining-the-project).
